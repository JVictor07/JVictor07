## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o, a Front End Developer from Brazil with knowledgeable in the process to develop, testing, debugging and maintenance of websites made with React.js and
applications made with React Native.

In the course of my career, I have helped companies to develop ecommerces, made technical decisions to build new projects, managed deliveries of new features and participated in the construction of applications with more than 100,000 monthly users.

In addition, I like a lot to study about entrepreneurship, Marketing, Growth Hacking and team management, so usually you can find me in the events about these topics on Brazil.
